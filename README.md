## :bar_chart: How It Works
1. **Audio Input**: Input audio is transcribed using AssemblyAI's transcription capabilities.
2. **Storage**: Transcribed data is stored in the Chroma vector database.
3. **Query Response**: User queries are answered using Retrieval Augmented Generation, providing detailed and accurate information.
4. **Conversation History**: Chat is keeping the history of preivous messages and is able to provide more accurate answers based on that.
